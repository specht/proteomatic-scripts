group: Proteomics/Identification/OMSSA/2. Filter PSM

title: Sanitize PSM

description: >
  Analyze PSM lists and remove hits to scans for which another hit with a 
  better score exists. In addition, hits to a scan with the same score but
  with contradicting peptides are discarded.

    description: >
      If this flag is activated, peptides will be converted to upper case, 
      thereby removing PTM information while filtering.

    type: flag
    default: true
    label: Remove similar GPF peptides
    description: >
      Remove all peptides identified via GPF in which a different 
      (most probably miscleaved) peptides was identified by GPF.
